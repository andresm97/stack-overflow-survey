With nearly 80,000 responses fielded from over 180 countries and dependent territories, the Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from career satisfaction and job search to education and opinions on open source software.

Here we try to fin the answer to this 3 questions:

-  What tools are the most use it by the developers?
-  What the developers do when they get stuck on a problem?
-  How the developers learn to code?

Whit this approach, we want to help the new generatios that whant to star a career in tech become better.
